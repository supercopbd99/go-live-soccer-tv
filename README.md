Baby Driver is one wild ride

So yeah, Baby Driver is pretty much a musical; La La Land without the singing and dancing and without Ryan Gosling, it’s Drive without the brutal head-bashing in the elevator and without.. erm.. Ryan Gosling, it’s Fast and Furious without the need for a frontal lobotomy and without Vin Diesel and it’s Heat without.. ummm.. well basically it’s Heat.
